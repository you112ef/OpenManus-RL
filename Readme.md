# OpenManus

OpenManus is an open-source initiative that aims to build a robust agent ecosystem capable of harnessing various powerful tools—such as the MCP tool base and web browsing—to achieve sophisticated reasoning and execution. We draw inspiration from existing works like **OSWorld**, **open-interpretor**, and more. **Code coming soon**!
